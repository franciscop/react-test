## Examples

These examples define some component or components, and then explain how to test them with `react-test`. The idea is to have a variety of examples so that some of them will be similar to your code.

These are the examples we want to have:

- `<Counter />`: increments when you click it.
- `<Todo />`: can add items with React's `useState()`.
- `<Signup />`: to see handling of forms
- `<Subscribe />`: to see how to test API calls.
- `<Portfolio />`: with React Router to see how routing works.
- Redux example: to see the possibilities of integration with Redux. Use [one from the official docs](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples).
